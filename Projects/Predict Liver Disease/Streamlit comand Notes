### Explanation:
1. **Bold Text**: Text between two sets of double asterisks (`**`) will be bold.
2. **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) before and after code blocks for code formatting.
3. **Inline Code**: Use single backticks (`) for inline code, but it's not necessary if you're using block code sections.

You can copy and paste this into your GitHub text file to have the bold text and proper formatting.
